## Introduction to Gas <a name="intro-gas"></a>

In Ethereum, 'gas' refers to the unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute certain operations. Every transaction in Ethereum requires a certain amount of gas to be executed.

## Understanding Gas Costs <a name="gas-costs"></a>

Gas costs depend on the complexity of computational tasks. Simple tasks, like sending Ether, require less gas than more complex tasks, like deploying a smart contract.

For instance, a simple ETH transfer requires 21000 gas units.

## Understanding Gas Price and Gas Limit <a name="gas-price-limit"></a>

- **Gas Price**: It's the amount of Ether you're willing to pay for every unit of gas. It is usually measured in 'Gwei' (1 Ether = 1 \* 10^9 Gwei). Higher gas prices incentivize miners to prioritize your transaction over others.

- **Gas Limit**: The maximum amount of gas you're willing to use for your transaction. A higher limit means more computational work can be done.

## Examples of Transactions and Gas Costs <a name="examples"></a>

1. **Example of Simple Ether Transfer**

A simple Ether transfer operation requires 21000 gas units. Let's say gas price is 20 Gwei,

Total cost = gas units _ gas price
= 21000 _ 20 Gwei
= 0.00042 Ether

2. **Example of Smart Contract Deployment**

Deploying a smart contract consumes more gas due to the complexity of the operation. For simple contract, it might take around 1,000,000 gas. If gas price is the same,

Total cost = gas units _ gas price
= 1,000,000 _ 20 Gwei
= 0.02 Ether

Remember, these are sample calculations and real-world costs may vary depending on the network congestion, complexity of the contract and other factors.

## Best Practices <a name="best-practices"></a>

1. **Estimate Gas Price**: Before submitting your transactions, it's a good practice to check the standard gas price (https://ethgasstation.info/).

2. **Set Appropriate Gas Limit**: To ensure your transaction doesn't run out of gas and fail, set a reasonable gas limit considering the operation to be performed.

3. **Revisit Gas Price for High Priority Transactions**: If a transaction needs to be processed quickly, a higher gas price can be set to incentivize miners.
