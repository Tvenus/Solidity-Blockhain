# WebIII ERC721 Contract Overview

The smart contract is based on the ERC721 standard, an Ethereum standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This contract makes use of several contract standards from the OpenZeppelin library, which helps with security by using standard contracts.

## Contract Inheritance

The contract imports and inherits from several OpenZeppelin contracts:

- `ERC721`: This is a standard interface for NFTs.
- `ERC721Enumerable`: This is an extension of `ERC721` that adds enumeration functionality, allowing tracking of total supply of tokens and allows querying by index.
- `Pausable`: This provides a function to pause and unpause various capabilities of the contract.
- `Ownable`: This provides functions to limit the access to certain functions to the contract's owner only.

## Contract Variables

- `uint256 maxSupply = 1;` The maximum supply of tokens with unique IDs is set to 1.
- `publicMintOpen` and `allowListMintOpen` boolean variables control the access to public and private (allowList) minting respectively.

## Contract Functions

- `_baseURI()`: This function is overriding the baseURI function to set the base URL for the token metadata.
- `pause()` and `unpause()`functions: These functions can only be called by account that is set as owner. These functions are used to pause and resume the smart contract functionality.
- `editMintWindow()`: This function is used to change the state of `publicMintOpen` and `allowListMintOpen`.
- `publicMint()` and `allowListMint()`: These are the functions that are used to mint new tokens for public or allowList users if the minting is open and sufficient Ether is sent along with the transaction.
- `setAllowList()`: This function lets an owner set a list of addresses that are given privilege to mint tokens.
- `internalMint()`: A private function that is responsible for creating tokens if the totalSupply of tokens is below `maxSupply`.
- `withdraw()`: A function that allows the owner to withdraw the balance of the contract.
- The `_beforeTokenTransfer()` is overridden to add the capability to pause token transfers.
- `supportsInterface()`: This overridden function ensures that the contract adheres to the ERC721 and ERC721Enumerable standard.

## Conclusion

This smart contract, as written, has a lot of features that make it flexible for use in different situations. The owner can control the minting process, the metadata for the NFTs is controlled, and the contract itself can be paused and restarted at need. The use of OpenZeppelin contracts also means that it's based on audited and community-verified code which increases its security.
