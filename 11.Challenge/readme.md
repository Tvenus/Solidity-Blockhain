# Crowdfunding Platform with NFT Raffle Rewards

This challenge combines the concepts of Simple Storage, FundMe, Raffle NFTs, and ERC20 tokens to build a crowdfunding platform where users can contribute funds to projects and have a chance to win unique NFT rewards through a raffle.

## Challenge

Your task is to build a crowdfunding platform with the following features:

1. **Simple Storage**: Implement a basic storage contract to keep track of the total amount of funds raised for each project.

2. **FundMe**: Create a contract that allows users to contribute funds to specific projects. Each project should have a unique identifier and a funding goal. Users should be able to contribute funds to a project and check the total amount raised for a project.

3. **Raffle NFTs**: Develop a contract that mints unique NFT tokens as raffle rewards. Each NFT should have a randomly generated identifier and associated metadata, such as name and description. Users who contribute funds to a project should automatically be entered into the raffle for a chance to win one of the NFT rewards.

4. **ERC20 Token**: Integrate an ERC20 token into the platform to facilitate fund transfers. Users should be able to deposit and withdraw ERC20 tokens to contribute funds and receive rewards. The token should also be used to track the balance of each user.

5. **Front-end Interaction**: Build a user interface that allows users to select a project, contribute funds, check the total amount raised, and view their raffle entries and rewards. The front-end should interact with the smart contracts using web3.js or a similar library.

This challenge will test your ability to combine different concepts and build a complex smart contract system. It will require you to implement various contract functionalities, handle fund transfers, manage NFT minting and raffle logic, and interact with an ERC20 token.

## Getting Started

To complete this challenge, follow these steps:

1. Create separate contracts for Simple Storage, FundMe, Raffle NFTs, and ERC20 token.
2. Integrate the contracts together to build the crowdfunding platform.
3. Develop a front-end interface using web3.js or a similar library to interact with the contracts.
4. Use proper error handling, security measures, and follow best practices while implementing the solution.

## Good Luck!

This challenge will help you practice your knowledge of Simple Storage, FundMe, Raffle NFTs, and ERC20 tokens. It will test your ability to combine these concepts and build a complex smart contract system. Remember to plan your implementation carefully and consider security and best practices.

Good luck with the challenge!
