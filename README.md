## About the Repository <a name="about"></a>

This repository is part of my in-depth learning journey following the Blockchain Developer, Smart Contract, & Solidity Course - Powered By AI - Beginner to Expert Course | Foundry Edition 2023. The repository contains a range of projects, each exploring a unique aspect of blockchain development, smart contracts, or Solidity programming.

## Setup & Installation <a name="setup"></a>

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tinotenda01/blockchain-solidity.git`
2. Set up foundry: `curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash`.

- This will install Foundryup, then simply follow the instructions on-screen, which will make the `foundryup` command available in your CLI.

- Running `foundryup` by itself will install the latest (nightly) precompiled binaries: `forge`,`cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`. Command `foundryup --help` for more options, like installing from a specific version or commit. For complete details about foundry See [docs](https://book.getfoundry.sh)
