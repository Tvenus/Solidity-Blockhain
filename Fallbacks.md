In Solidity, "fallback" and "receive" are special functions that are used to handle incoming ether and data that is sent to a contract.

The fallback function is a special function that is executed when a contract receives a transaction that does not match any of its defined functions. This can happen when a user sends ether to the contract without specifying a function to call. The fallback function is optional and has the following signature:

```
function () external payable {
    // code to handle incoming ether without data
}
```

The fallback function is marked as "payable" to allow it to receive ether. If the fallback function is not defined and a transaction is sent to the contract without specifying a function to call, the transaction will fail and the ether will be returned to the sender.

The receive function is a new function that was introduced in Solidity version 0.6.0. It is similar to the fallback function, but it is specifically designed to handle incoming data without any accompanying ether. The receive function has the following signature:

```
function () external payable {
    // code to handle incoming ether without data
}
```

The receive function is also marked as "payable" to allow it to receive ether in case it is sent with data. The receive function is called automatically when a contract receives a transaction with data but no function specifier. If the receive function is not defined and a transaction is sent to the contract with data but no function specifier, the transaction will fail.

In summary, the fallback function is used to handle incoming ether and data when no other function matches the transaction, while the receive function is used to handle incoming data without any accompanying ether.
