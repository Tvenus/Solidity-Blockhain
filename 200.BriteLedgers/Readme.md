# BriteLedgers V1

BriteLedgers is a protocol designed to enable supply chain stakeholders in Africa to leverage the power of decentralised technology. This protocol is being developed with the help of Foundry, a comprehensive suite of tools for building and deploying decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It seeks to build a bridge that will allow businesses from healthcare, finance, and other industries to integrate blockchain technology into their supply chains.
