/// @title Transactions Ledger for Supply Chain Protocol
/// @author Tinotenda Joe
/// @notice This contract serves as a decentralized ledger for recording transactions within a supply chain protocol. It supports creating, retrieval, and count tracking of transaction entries.
/// @dev TODO: Implement Access Control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl library. For example:
/// @dev     `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";`
/// @dev     `contract Transactions is AccessControl {...}`
/// @dev TODO: Add more events to capture important state changes. For example:
/// @dev     `event TransactionUpdated(bytes32 transactionHash, address updatedBy);`
/// @dev TODO: Include error messages in your revert statements. For example:
/// @dev     `require(msg.sender == Owner, "Only the owner can perform this action");`
/// @dev TODO: Maintain a history of all transactions related to a commodity. For example:
/// @dev     `struct Transaction { address from; address to; uint256 timestamp; }`
/// @dev     `Transaction[] public transactions;`
/// @dev TODO: Add functionality to manage commodity batches separately. For example:
/// @dev     `struct Batch { uint256 id; uint256 quantity; }`
/// @dev     `Batch[] public batches;`
/// @dev TODO: Add functions to record quality assurance checks. For example:
/// @dev     `function recordQualityCheck(uint256 result) public {...}`
/// @dev TODO: Consider how your contract will interact with external systems. For example:
/// @dev     `function makePayment(address payee, uint256 amount) public {...}`
/// @dev TODO: Make your contract upgradeable using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library. For example:
/// @dev     `import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";`
/// @dev     `contract Transactions is Initializable {...}`
/// @dev TODO: Write comprehensive tests for your contract.
/// @dev TODO: Review your contract for potential security issues. Consider having it audited by a professional.
