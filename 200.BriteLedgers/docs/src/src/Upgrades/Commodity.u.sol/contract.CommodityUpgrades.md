This contract represents a commodity in a supply chain.

*It includes functions for managing the commodity's status and the parties involved in its shipment.*

*TODO: Implement Access Control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl library. For example:*

*`import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";`*

*`contract Commodity is AccessControl {...}`*

*TODO: Add more events to capture important state changes. For example:*

*`event QualityCheckCompleted(address indexed inspector, uint256 result);`*

*TODO: Include error messages in your revert statements. For example:*

*`require(msg.sender == manufacturer, "Only the manufacturer can perform this action");`*

*TODO: Maintain a history of all transactions related to a commodity. For example:*

*`struct Transaction { address from; address to; uint256 timestamp; }`*

*`Transaction[] public transactions;`*

*TODO: Add functionality to manage commodity batches separately. For example:*

*`struct Batch { uint256 id; uint256 quantity; }`*

*`Batch[] public batches;`*

*TODO: Add functions to record quality assurance checks. For example:*

*`function recordQualityCheck(uint256 result) public {...}`*

*TODO: Consider how your contract will interact with external systems. For example:*

*`function makePayment(address payee, uint256 amount) public {...}`*

*TODO: Make your contract upgradeable using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts library. For example:*

*`import "@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";`*

*`contract Commodity is Initializable {...}`*

*TODO: Write comprehensive tests for your contract.*

*TODO: Review your contract for potential security issues. Consider having it audited by a professional.*
